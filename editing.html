        <p id="aboutMe">Since 2017, I have been making videos for my youtube channel.
            I make these videos because I enjoy making them. Most of the videos on my channel
            do not have heavy editing, but there are some that I put a lot of passion and work
            into in order to make them good for me. I enjoy making videos because it lets me be
            as creative as I want to. I have used programs like sony vegas, premier pro, after effects
            windows moviemaker, iMovie, and daVinci resolve to make my videos. My love for video editing
            began when I watched different minecraft youtubers when I was little. I liked how they used
            editing to compliment the great content they already had. In a way video editing is like html
            and css, where the html is the content, and the css is what makes the content appealing.
